## [To be completed] Cloud Cost Optimization - AWS Cloud <br/>
About Cost Optimization techniques in AWS Cloud. Cloud Cost Optimization. <br/>

* [As per AWS Well-Architected frameworkCost Optimization pillar](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/2020-07-02T19-33-23/wat.pillar.costOptimization.en.html) includes the ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point. <br/>
* Optimizing cloud costs isn't just about reducing costs; it's also about aligning costs with business goals. An increase in costs is not necessarily a problem if it's accompanied by an increase in revenue. One of the most important goals is to ensure that costs correlate with productive and profitable activities. <br/>
* There are three fundamental drivers of cost with AWS which should be kept in mind while architecting solutions  : compute, storage, and outbound data transfer. <br/>
* [Generic AWS Guidance on cost optimization](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-optimization/)<br/>
* [AWS Cost Calculation example](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/how-aws-pricing-works/cost-calculation-examples.html) are is a good place to start. It is essential to measure the benefit/efficiency of a workload by business to justify the costs associated with it <br/>
* Upgrade instances to latest generation : They typically provide higher efficiency or better performance at a lower price. When AWS releases a new generation of instances, they tend to have improved performance and functionality compared to their predecessors. This means customers can either upgrade existing instances to the latest generation, or downsize existing instances with borderline utilization metrics in order to benefit from the same level of performance at lower cost.<br/>
* (Optimize storage) Delete unattached EBS volumes :a good practice is to check “delete on termination” box when an instance is launched. A simple AWS Lamda function can be writted to delete unused EBS volumes.<br/>
* (Optimize storage) Delete obsolete snapshots. <br/>
* Release unattached Elastic IP addresses : EIP's are free of change when attached to running service. Exceptions to the free of charge rule occur if customers remap an IP address more than 100 times a month, or if retain an unattached Elastic IP address after terminating the instances to which they were attached. AWS charges for such EIP's. <br/>
* (Optimize storage) Move infrequently-accessed data to lower cost tiers : Store production files in S3 and move them between storage tiers based on activity, or dynamically using S3 Smart Tiering. Archive infrequently used data in S3 Glacier and back up long-term archived data in Glacier Deep Archive. <br/>
* Schedule instances to ensure they run only during business hours or when needed. This is achieved automatically by using AWS Instance Scheduler or other tools. <br/>
* Terminate zombie assets : The term “zombie assets” is most often used to describe any unused asset contributing to the cost of operating in the AWS Cloud. Sometimes it may be diffcult to find all assets and 3rd party tools like VMWare CloudHealth can help. <br/>
* Tag AWS resources : Tagging helps to having a cost-conscious culture, establishing guardrails to meet financial targets, and gain greater business efficiencies. A good resource tagging policy can save costs. For example, resources with non-production tags can be de-provisioned or shut down in holidays or when not used. Tags helps to analyze and attribute expenditure. Tags makes it easier to accurately identify the usage and cost of systems, which then allows transparent attribution of IT costs to individual workload owners. This helps measure return on investment (ROI) and gives workload owners an opportunity to optimize their resources and reduce costs. Tagging resources increases the amount of data monitoring tools can obtain. <br/>
* Right size instances : The purpose of rightsizing is to match instance sizes to their workloads. This ensures substantial cost savings. <br/>
* Increase elasticity : Cloud enables to optimize costs to meet dynamic needs, turning resources off when they are no longer needed.  This should be leveraged to the fullest. <br/>
* Measure, monitor, and improve : As cloud environments are dynamic so measurements and monitoring for accurate visibility and continuous costs optimization is essential. One simple approach is defining and enforcing cost allocation tagging, define metrics and specific targets. <br/>
